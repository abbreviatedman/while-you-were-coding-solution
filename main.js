console.log('\nChallenge #1\n');

// Console out the numbers from 1-20, but only if they're divisible by 3.

// Use `if` and a modulus operation.


console.log('\nChallenge #2\n');

// Same problem as #1, but no `if`s, `mods`, or `but`s (and no, that last one is
// not a thing). If you did it right, you should run the loop 6 times with 1
// console log per loop. That's called... a clue!


console.log('\nChallenge #3\n');

// Console out the numbers from 1-20. BACKWARDS.

// (And, optionally, in heels.)

// (That's a reference that only Olds make, and only if they're SUPER CULTURED.)

// (No extra credit will be given for wearing heels during this challenge.)


console.log('\nChallenge #4\n');

// For the string 'Boy howdy am I good at this!', console out the letters
// individually.


console.log('\nChallenge #5\n');

// For the string 'Am I the best?', console out the letters individually, AND
// UPPERCASED.


console.log('\nChallenge #6\n');

// For the string 'Whoa, I am the best!', console out the letters individually,
// but also capitalize the letters in the third word.


console.log('\nChallenge #7\n');


// For the string 'I am become death, destroyer of worlds.', console out the letters
//  individually, but backwards. That is, the first console log should be
// `!`, followed by `s`, followed by `i`, and so on.


console.log('\nChallenge #8\n');

const names = 'Colin|Mesuara|Drew|In Seop|Emma|Ben|J|Ryan|Olgy|Mike|Chris|John';

// Console out the individual letters of each person in class today, which are
// in the string above.

// You'll know you're at a new person's name when you hit the pipe character.

// Don't print the pipes!
